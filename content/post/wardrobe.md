Our previous house had a walk-in closet, and as a result, we had nearly no storage for clothing.  The master bedroom had sufficient space, but we didn't want to just pile a dresser (or two) in to fit our clothes.  Instead, we designed, built, and installed a warddrobe system, and to my eye, it looks like it fits in quite nicely.
