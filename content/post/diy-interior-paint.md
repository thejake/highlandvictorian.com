# Before
Another task that's far easier before furniture, is interior paint.  Obviously color is simply a matter of personal preference, but it's the first of (what I expect will be many) DIY projects that I'm woefully unprepared for.  The previous owners had different tastes; favoring yellows and deep reds.

# After
We favor more earth-toned colors, and went with a scheme of greens, blues, greys, and creamy whites.

Many of the rooms took more work than we anticipated.  In part, that was because we didn't know how to paint, but the prep work took more time than anything.  In one of the bedrooms, there were dozens (if not hundreds) of small holes in the walls that needed attention.
