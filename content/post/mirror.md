While not worthy of much fanfare, we're really happy with a decorating upgrade to the 1st floor bathroom.  While the previous owners had taken some mirror from this spot, we've been doing without.  The empty space was obvious, but we hadn't found the right period-appropriate mirror.  That changed today.

We got a beautiful solid cherry-wood mirror from KentwoodMirrors.
